Beta-alanine contributes to carnosine production, functioning as a \"cleansing\" agent for your muscles by preventing the buildup of lactic acid and delaying excessive oxygenation. This means it delays muscle fatigue and extends your active time. L-citrulline and L-arginine, also present in the blend, impact nitric oxide production, widening blood vessels to enhance nutrient and oxygen delivery to working muscles. Lastly, but not least, L-tyrosine acts as a precursor to adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine.\r\n\r\nThe ingredients in the \"Concentrated\" pre-workout stimulant make it a highly effective booster suitable for both strength athletes and those engaging in endurance-demanding sports.
